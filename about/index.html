    Hey, I am Anna! Luckily Anna is widely used in countries across the world because I love travelling, exploring new places and meeting new people. And let’s not forget about tasting new foods! For the last few years, I have been studying ICT at FAU and am about to graduate in April. I am passionate about the intersection of technology, design and humanities and have worked in various areas related to audio and speech processing. Whenever I don’t have the chance to travel abroad, I like to play classical guitar, read books and meet friends. My audio related projects for 2022 are building a loudspeaker by myself and learning about mixing to improve voice-overs and audio quality for video production.
If anyone likes to share tips or traveller stories, I am always up for a talk!

    I‘m Maryam and come from Iran. I study M.Sc of Communications and Multimedia Engineering at FAU. My passion for signal processing has led me to many experiences with its applications in biomedical and communications engineering areas and now, I‘m warmly welcoming audio and music processing! Currently, I have a student job at the AudioLabs in music processing field.
    In my free time, I go out for a walk at random places and enjoy a podcast, I learn German(!), read books and cook! Cats, coffee, singing and meeting new people are my non-signal processing passions! :D
    All in all, I do enjoy meeting and communicating with people, and putting a smile on your face! :)

        My enthusiasm for audio and passion for music brought me to pursue a Ph.D. in the field of music information retrieval at the International Audio Laboratories Erlangen. In my daily work, I conduct research on signal processing tools for analyzing multitrack recordings of polyphonic singing. In my free time, I play guitar and piano. Also, I like to play around with audio equipment and record my own songs. I am always happy to connect and meet new people.

    Hello everyone, this is Komal and I am from India. I have done my Bachelor's in Electronics Engineering and am currently pursuing Masters in Communication and Multimedia Engineering. I joined FAU this winter semester and am still exploring various fields, but 🎧 Audio is the one that has definitely caught my attention and interest.
During my school days, I pursued Indian classical music for two years. I started learning to play the guitar at the beginning of the pandemic but couldn't bring it to Germany due to the luggage constraints 😅 I would definitely like to start again 😁. I love reading, traveling and learning new languages. I speak English, Hindi, Marathi, Korean and am learning German. I run a motivational website called <a href="http://charmingchallenges.com" target="_blank">charmingchallenges.com</a>, although I haven't been very active on it on the past year, I intend to start working on it soon again.
<p>I am always excited to meet and connect to people and learning from their experiences!

        I play clarinet (Bartok + learning some of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Duets-Complete-Including-Vol-I-II-III/dp/B001ANVT10">Bop duets</a> + scales atm) and sometimes piano (currently learning BWV 847). I'm dancing the Lindy Hop (also started with choreographies last week again :D) and doing a PhD at AudioLabs in distributed audio systems. I'm a member of the Rust Machine Learning group and like to tinker in functional programming and statistics. My favorite authors are Pratchett, Moers, Dragt and Gaiman and currently I'm reading a book by Clemens Setz. I also like to sail!
